                <span class="chap">Chapter 3</span>
                <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
                    the
                    app
                    platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as
                    well as to
                    describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable,
                    nestable
                    code. You
                    can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React
                    Native.</p>
                <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <p> <span class="bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                    examples: friendly, approachable
                    creatures
                    that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">+ JSX</span>. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                    elements
                    inside JavaScript like so:
                    <span class="bc">&ltText&gtHello, I am your cat!&lt&#47Text&gt</span>.
                </p>
                <p>The React docs have <span class="under">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn
                    even
                    more. Because JSX is
                    JavaScript, you
                    can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="bg">name</span> for the cat,
                    name,
                    and embedding it with
                    curly braces
                    inside <span class="bc">&ltText&gt</span></p>
                <p><span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
                    components render, state is
                    like a
                    component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that
                    comes from
                    user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

            <div id="handling-text-input">
                <h2>HANDLING TEXT INPUT</h2>
                <span class="chap">Chapter 4</span>
                <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                        class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes
                    a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
                    function
                    to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                    language.
                    In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there
                    Bob"
                    would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
